## Install

### Machine-Wide (simpler and convenient)

`npm install -g instapack`

If you encounter [errors](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/18380) during installation, try:

- Using command prompt [as Administrator](https://www.howtogeek.com/194041/how-to-open-the-command-prompt-as-administrator-in-windows-8.1/) or elevated privileges (`sudo`), update npm: `npm install -g npm`, clear the npm cache: `npm cache clean --force` and then: `npm install -g instapack --no-optional`

- **Or use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) instead:** `yarn global add instapack`

### Per-Project (consistent build)

`npm install instapack@[version] -D -E` or `yarn add instapack@[version] -D -E` 

- Modify the project `package.json`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "ipack"
  }
}
```

- Invoke instapack using [`npm run build`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) or [`yarn run build`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/run/)

- **Alternatively, invoke instapack without modifying `package.json` using:** [`npx ipack` or `npx instapack`](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b)

## Quick Start Guide

```powershell
cd E:\VS\MyWebApp
ipack new empty
ipack
```

Out of the box, these files will be used as the program entry points:

- `client/js/index.ts` compiled to `wwwroot/js/ipack.js`

  - Include this file at the bottom of your HTML / before `</body>` using `<script>` so the browser can render the page while downloading the script.

  - Anything imported from `node_modules` will be put into `ipack.dll.js`. Please also include this file in your HTML just before `ipack.js`

- `client/css/index.scss` compiled to `wwwroot/css/ipack.css`

  - Include this file at the top of your HTML / before `</head>` using `<link>` so the browser can style and render the page as it loads.

  - Spiced :hot_pepper: with [AutoPrefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for applying CSS vendor-prefixes automatically!

- Concatenate files listed in `package.json` ([Read more ↓](#configurations))

  - Usually the output file should be included in the HTML before `ipack.js`

Practical guides can be read in the [books](https://github.com/ryanelian/instapack/tree/master/books) folder.

## System Requirements

Currently supported Node.js is [the latest version 8 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

When using [Visual Studio 2017 (Update 2 or above)](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/), install [the latest TypeScript SDK for Visual Studio 2017](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55258).

When using Visual Studio 2015 (Update 3 or above), install [the latest TypeScript SDK for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48593).

If using [the latest Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it should come with the latest TypeScript support out of the box.

## Design Philosophies

- Zero configurations: Hyper-opinionated front-end project build system. **It just works!** :sparkling_heart:

- Unify and standardize team build system across multiple projects, for any JS frameworks. :fist:

- Built-in new project scaffold tool for assorted JS frameworks. :gift:

- Rich debugging experience: set breakpoints, view variables, and step into the TypeScript source code! :mag:

- Beginner-friendly: Lower the barrier of entry for developing a modern web app. :balloon:

- Introduce structure to the front-end source code using standard module systems. :city_sunrise:

- Improve source code quality and maintainability with type hints and compile-time checks. :eyeglasses:

- Enforce best practices when building apps, which may significantly impact page load time. :hammer_and_wrench: (i.e. tree-shaking, code-splitting, bundling, and minification) 

- Blur the boundary between design-time and coding-time using lightning-fast `watch` + `dev` build mode. :zap:

## But... Why?

Recently, *every hecking framework on this planet* :earth_asia: has their own CLI; but only few are able to support TypeScript as first-class feature. Thus, most people gave up on TypeScript right off the bat... :bat:

instapack is an initiative to develop a command line tool for compiling most apps developed using mainstream JS frameworks, with a :lemon: twist: **It can easily build an app written in TypeScript with minimal configurations!**

instapack is battle-tested :hocho: and is designed to cover *most normal use cases* when developing a modern web app. Powered by [webpack](https://webpack.js.org), instapack effortlessly devours modules written using modern JS standards (ES Harmony, CommonJS, AMD, UMD) and more (HTML templates, Vue SFC).

With this powerful tool, you can save time :watch:, save precious SSD space :space_invader:, and save yourself from the pain of manually maintaining project build scripts! :coffee:

## Commands

You may use `instapack` or `ipack` to invoke the command line interface.

### new [template]

Scaffolds a new instapack project into your existing app folder where the command line is invoked. These templates are available:

- `empty` for a minimal clean slate.

- `vue` for developing a web app using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/). 

  - Includes [aspnet-validation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspnet-validation) for ASP.NET MVC client-side validation.

- `react` for developing a web app using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/).

- `angular` for developing a web app using [the new Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Material Design](https://material.angular.io/). (Warnings: [1](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/11580) [2](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/21560))

- `preact` for developing a web app using [Preact](https://preactjs.com/). (Fast 3kB alternative to React)

- `inferno` for developing a web app using [Inferno](https://infernojs.org/). (Insanely fast, React-like)

- `hyperapp` for developing a web app using [hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp). (1kB, with state management)

- `mithril` for developing a web app using [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/) and [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/). (hyperscript, provides routing and XHR)

- `vue-mobile` for developing a _[Progressive Web Application](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/)_ using Vue.js and [Onsen UI](https://onsen.io/vue/)! ([Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org)-compatible, [read more on FAQ ↓](#how-to-develop-a-cordova-app-using-vue-mobile-template))

- `angularjs` for developing a *legacy* web app using [AngularJS 1.7](https://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/).

  - Includes [jquery-validation-unobtrusive](https://github.com/aspnet/jquery-validation-unobtrusive) for ASP.NET MVC client-side validation.

If no template parameter is provided, `vue` will be chosen. :vulcan_salute:

### build [project]

Performs compilation of selected project type. Available projects: `all`, `js`, `css` and `concat`. If no project parameter is provided, `all` will be chosen.

In addition, build flags are available:

- `--watch` or `-w` enables automatic incremental build on source code changes. :robot:

- `--dev` or `-d` disables build outputs optimization and minification for **FAST build!** :fire:

- `--xdebug` or `-x` disables source maps, producing undebuggable outputs. (Slightly improves build speed)

- `--stats` generates `stats.json` next to the TypeScript build outputs, which can be fed to [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer) or [webpack-visualizer](http://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/). For sanity, this flag will be ignored when using `-d` or `-w` flags.

> You can combine multiple build flags, for example: `ipack -dw` = `dev` + `watch` mode for **massive productivity gainz!** :muscle:

### clean

Remove all files in the output folders.

### set <key> <value>

- `package-manager` allows setting default package manager to be used for restoring and integrity-checking `node_modules` prior build. Possible values: `yarn`, `npm`, `disabled` (default: `yarn`)

- `mute-notification` disables toast alert on build fails in watch mode when set to `true`. Possible values: `true` and `false` (default: `false`)

## Configurations

instapack puts configurations inside `package.json` to reduce project files clutter. For example, this is the included `package.json` with `vue` template:

> `name`, `version`, `private`, `dependencies`, and `devDependencies` fields were removed for brevity.

```json
{
  "instapack": {
    "output": "wwwroot",
    "concat": {},
    "alias": {
      "vue": "vue/dist/vue.esm",
      "jquery": "jquery/dist/jquery.slim"
    }
  }
}
```

- `input` allows setting the input folder name. By default, it is set to `client`

- `output` allows setting the output folder name. By default, it is set to `wwwroot`

- `jsOut` allows setting the JS output file name. By default, it is set to `ipack.js`

- `cssOut` allows setting the CSS output file name. By default, it is set to `ipack.css`

- `alias` allows overriding module `import` calls from all files, including dependencies. [Read more ↗](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/)

  - [TypeScript `paths` compiler option in `tsconfig.json`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html) will be translated into aliases with caveats:
  
    - For non-`*` paths: due to technical limitations, only the first path in the string array will be honored.

- `externals` allows rewriting module `import` calls from all files, including dependencies, to globally exposed objects via `window` object. [Read more ↗](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/)

For example:

```json
{
  "instapack": {
    "externals": {
      "jquery": "$"
    }
  }
}
```

```ts
// converts this...
import jQuery from 'jquery';

// into something similar to this...
// const jQuery = window["$"];
```

so [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) can be used! :tada:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/jquery@3.3.1/dist/jquery.js"></script>
```

- `concat` allows packing browser libraries to be consumed directly from `<script src="...">` rather than as a module.

  - The file names will be resolved node-style (**but NOT their contents**), which allows concatenating packages downloaded from `npm` to be bundled, minified, and then placed into the output JS folder. 

  - Use concatenation for libraries that cannot be imported / do not need to be imported (for example, jQuery plugins). This hybrid approach allows excellent interop with older libraries!

  - For consuming the libraries within the TypeScript app code: include the concatenated file **BEFORE** the app bundle then...
  
    - Combo with the `externals` module configuration for easy import using `require` / [CommonJS module syntax](#commonjs--nodejs-require).

    - Alternatively (for strongly-typed import), write a TypeScript module declaration (`declare module`) then import using [ES Modules syntax](#typescript--es-modules).

    - Possible but not recommended: reference the library objects directly from the `window` (e.g. `window['$']`).

**A `concat` configuration example:** (produces `vendor.js` bundle handy for ASP.NET MVC)

```json
{
  "instapack": {
    "concat": {
      "vendor": [
        "jquery",
        "jquery-validation",
        "jquery-validation-unobtrusive",
        "./client/lib/my-ancient-jquery-plugin"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

instapack version 6.4.0+ supports defining variables in `process.env` global object. Variables coming from `process.env` are always strings.

> Using `process.env` in your TypeScript project requires `@types/node` package installed.

### .env

The file [`.env`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) in the root project folder will be read and parsed.

**For example:** `FOO=bar` will define `process.env.FOO` as `'bar'`

> Due to technical reasons, `.env` file cannot be watched.

### --env

Build flag `--env` accepts object-like notation: 

- Variables passed using the flag will be merged with variables defined in `.env`

- Variables passed using the flag takes takes priority / overrides the variables defined in `.env`

**For example:** `ipack --env.FOO=bar --env.HELLO=world`

## TSLint Integration

instapack version 6.5.0+ supports [`tslint.json` / `tslint.yaml`](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/configuration/) in the project root folder. Here are some sensible, useful [rules](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/rule-flags/) which greatly reduce programming blunders:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "ban-comma-operator": true,
    "curly": true,
    "no-conditional-assignment": true,
    "no-duplicate-super": true,
    "no-duplicate-switch-case": true,
    "no-dynamic-delete": true,
    "no-eval": true,
    "no-for-in-array": true,
    "no-object-literal-type-assertion": true,
    "no-shadowed-variable": true,
    "no-sparse-arrays": true,
    "no-string-throw": true,
    "no-unbound-method": true,
    "no-unsafe-finally": true,
    "no-var-keyword": true,
    "switch-default": true,
    "triple-equals": true,
    "use-isnan": true,
    "class-name": true,
    "interface-name": true,
    "variable-name": [
      true,
      "check-format",
      "ban-keywords"
    ]
  }
}
```

> Source file will be linted only when it can be compiled correctly.

## Babel Integration (BETA)

instapack version 6.4.0+ supports `.babelrc` in the project root folder. Here are some use cases where this feature can be useful:

- You may use Babel instead of TypeScript to transpile JS to ES5: set TypeScript `target` to `esnext` then use `@babel/preset-env`

- You may use Babel instead of TypeScript to compile JSX: set TypeScript `jsx` to `preserve` then use the framework-compatible JSX plugin. For example: `babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx`, `babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx`, `babel-plugin-inferno`

## Module Systems

### TypeScript / ES Modules

[Imports and exports](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html) other `.ts` / `.tsx` files in the project or normal JS modules from `node_modules`. This technique allows the ease of development using intellisense for modules with type definitions:

- The module has `"typings": "something.d.ts"` in its `package.json`. For example: `vue`, `linq`

- The module has [@types](https://microsoft.github.io/TypeSearch/) installed. For example, `react` and `@types/react`

```ts
import List from 'linq';
```

> When the imported module does not have any type definitions, it will be imported as `any` data type (no intellisense).

### ES Modules: Dynamic Import

instapack version 6.4.0+ supports code-splitting using ES Modules dynamic `import()` syntax:

```ts
import('lunr').then(lunr => {
  // similar to: import * as lunr from 'lunr'
});
```

An excerpt of build log when using dynamic import:

```
[02:41:10] ipack.0.js 70.1 kB
[02:41:10] ipack.dll.js 220 kB
[02:41:10] ipack.js 2.76 kB
```

- Unlike `ipack.dll.js` which must be referenced explicitly before `ipack.js`, the `lunr` module in `ipack.0.js` **will be automatically downloaded on-demand** to reduce asset size during initial page load.

- The `import()` method returns a `Promise` object which resolves to the downloaded module, which can be `await`-ed in TypeScript!

- The number `0` is an auto-generated chunk name, which can be overridden using the *magic comment* `import(/* webpackChunkName: "lunr" */ 'lunr')` (generates `ipack.lunr.js` instead).

- **This feature will be especially useful when a gigantic library is required in just one or two components, but not the whole app!**

> To use this syntax within TypeScript, `module` compiler option in `tsconfig.json` must be set to `esnext` (instead of the usual `es2015`).

### CommonJS / Node.js require

- Easily imports ordinary JS modules within the project or from `node_modules`. However, **you will NOT get intellisense!** (Modules will be imported as `any` data type.)

- Imports a static JSON file to be parsed as JS object.

```js
let $ = require('jquery');
let settings = require('./settings.json') as ISettings;
```

- Imports an `.html` file to be minified and then stringified. This technique is invaluable for working with frameworks relying on HTML-based templates such as AngularJS, mustache.js / Handlebars.js, and Vue.js:

```ts
let template = require('./mytemplate.html') as string;
```

> CommonJS `require` method in TypeScript is provided through `@types/requirejs` or `@types/node` packages.

> Use `as` type-hint for clarity and convenience.

### Vue Single-File Components (BETA)

instapack version 6.4.0+ can compile `.vue` files:

```vue
<template>
<h1>Hello from {{ compiler }} and {{ framework }}!</h1>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import Vue from 'vue';
import Component from 'vue-class-component';
@Component({
    props: ['framework', 'compiler']
})
export default class Hello extends Vue {
    framework: string;
    compiler: string;
}
</script>
```

- The HTML `<template>` will be compiled Ahead-of-Time (AoT) for greater app startup performance!

- When using Visual Studio Code with [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur) extension, you will get fabulous intellisense! :star2:

- Basic `<style>` (or `<style scoped>` or `<style module>`) should work, but should *not* be used. 

  - **This feature is not supported** [at least until webpack ships built-in CSS modules](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/6448).

  - **Limitations:** You cannot use Sass. The CSS will not be auto-prefixed and minified.
  
  - **Reduced project maintainability:** Your CSS will be scattered across obscure files in the JS project. Non-scoped styles will pollute the global CSS namespace.

- [A global TypeScript definition file for `*.vue` module](https://github.com/ryanelian/instapack/blob/master/templates/vue/client/js/vue-shim.d.ts) is required for importing the `.vue` file using ES Modules syntax from TypeScript.

  - This file will be created for you when using the `vue` new project template!

### Sass @import

instapack also has a custom Node-like but standard-compliant Sass module system using `@import` syntax, which picks up CSS files for convenience:

- Include files relative to the source, which include _partial.scss files. (Standard Sass behavior)

- Include files relative to the source in a named folder, but as `index.scss` or `_index.scss` ([Standard Sass behavior](https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/690)) or `index.css`

- Include files resolved from `node_modules`. Also reads `package.json` to resolve **CSS** file in `style` field!

## Release Cadence

Starting version 4.0.0, instapack follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

Bi-weekly releases (usually on 14th and 28th date of each month) will be performed for updating package dependencies. Bug reports will be dealt promptly. These actions will increment the patch version.

New non-breaking features will increment the minor version. Breaking changes will increment the major version. [View breaking changes here.](BREAKING.md)

Occasionally, beta builds will be published (`instapack@beta`) for showcasing the bleeding edge version of the tool.

Alternatively, you may build directly from the source code repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ryanelian/instapack.git
cd instapack
.\link.ps1
.\build.ps1
ipack --version
```

## FAQ

### Can I use [insert_framework_name_here] ?

Yes, absolutely!

**If it worked when using standard JS, it WILL work with instapack.**

Add the packages required for your project using npm / Yarn and then start hacking. We'll take care of the outputs.

Also, pull requests are welcomed if you have a great starting templates and books for those projects. We'd love to expand our collections!

### How to debug using Visual Studio Code?

Install the [VS Code extension: Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome), open the project using VS Code (`package.json` should be located on your workspace folder root).

Create a folder `.vscode` and a file `launch.json` inside it:

```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Chrome",
            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "launch",
            "url": "http://localhost:43371/",
            "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "smartStep": true
        }
    ]
}
```

Replace the `url` parameter with the correct URL of your app, then press **F5** on your keyboard!

### How to develop a Cordova app using vue-mobile template?

```powershell
cordova create MyProject
cd MyProject
ipack new vue-mobile
cordova platform add android ios browser
yarn
ipack -dw               # then change www/index.html <script> and <link> tags.
cordova run browser     # re-run commmand every time build outputs change
```

> **CAUTION:** `cordova platform add` and `cordova plugin add` (or remove) will destroy your `node_modules`. Re-run `yarn` / `npm install` after invoking those commands!

Alternatively, you can use `phonegap serve` for development due to Browsersync playing nice with instapack watch. You will need to remove / comment / edit the `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` tag though.

Later on...

```
cordova build android
cordova build ios
```

### I thought files should not be bundled because of HTTP/2?

[Nope.](https://medium.com/@asyncmax/the-right-way-to-bundle-your-assets-for-faster-sites-over-http-2-437c37efe3ff)

Also, in IIS, HTTP/2 is only supported when using Windows Server 2016. Many of our customers are still using Windows Server 2012 R2 to date.

### Can I change the index.ts / index.scss entry point?

Nope.

### Can I change the js / css folder name?

Nope.

### Can I build multiple entry points?

Nope. 

However, you can _eject_ the `client` folder out of the back-end project folder, rename the `jsOut` file, and then redirect the `output` folder path back into the assets folder of the back-end project. This is the preferred way of doing things because:

- You may have multiple front-end projects for a single back-end project.

- Every front-end project can have vastly different `tsconfig.json` and `package.json` setup.

- Prevents front-end projects from screwing around with each other's code.

### My package restore / IDE is slow. Help!

Windows Defender or other anti-virus software appear to slow down package restore and IDEs when opening projects.

For this very reason, it is highly recommended to:

- Add anti-virus exclusion to Yarn installation folder: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Yarn`. To double check, type: `where.exe yarn`

- Add anti-virus exclusion to Yarn cache folder: `C:\Users\Ryan\AppData\Local\Yarn`. To double check, type: `yarn cache dir`

- Add anti-virus exclusion to NodeJS installation folder: `C:\Program Files\nodejs`. To double check, type: `where.exe node`

- Add anti-virus exclusion to `%APPDATA%\npm` and [`%APPDATA%\npm-cache`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/cache) folders.

- Add anti-virus exclusion to Git installation folder: `C:\Program Files\Git`. To double check, type: `where.exe git`

- Use very short root folder name for projects, such as `D:\VS`, to avoid potential problems with Windows system paths over 260 characters long. Then exclude the folder from the anti-virus.

### Your PowerShell is cute. How to?

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser
iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')
scoop install concfg
concfg import firefly
```
